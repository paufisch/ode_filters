# ODE Filters Documentation

Welcome to the lightweight documentation hub for `ode-filters`. The goal is to provide a concise map of the codebase and point you toward hands-on resources.

## Project Layout

- `ode_filters/`: Core filtering, smoothing, and inference routines.
- `test/`: Pytest suite covering inference primitives and filter loops.
- `examples.ipynb`: End-to-end walkthrough of the probabilistic ODE solver pipeline.
